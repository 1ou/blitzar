The code style.

Not a single null

Not a single public static method

Min number of mutable classes

Not a single instanceof keyword, type casting, or reflection

I'm trying to use here as many interfaces as I can. I'm trying to find the border with enough amount of structures. (when it's better to use abstract class, when class, when interface). I'm thinking it's kinda The Sixth Sense :) 

Todo:

1. Storing databases +
2. Storing tables

    - data in b-tree +
3. Server +
4. Translate sql queries
5. Database transactions
